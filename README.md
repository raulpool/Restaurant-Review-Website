# Restaurant-Review-Website
Attempting to create a website that mimcs Yelp. 
Although, I have used Laravel twice, I am still not proficient enough to make the website flawless. I attempted to include all the requirements neccessary for the project. This was the first of two project I developed for this course. The main reasons why I decided to do a second project were to attempt and learn AngularJS and because I have never hosted a website online. I attempted to find tutorials online but none of themr eally helped, or clarified, what I needed to learn.

This website does have an issue the user chooses to register the browser doesn't let the command go through, it makes me clear the cookies in order for it to work again. However, the user does get registered and entered into the database.

In order to run the application properly WAMP,LAMP, or MAMP needs to be installed in the computer. 
I wasn't sure how to include my database, and the professor had stated that he didn't want the database as well!
