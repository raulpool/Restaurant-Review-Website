# Restaurant-Review-Website
Attempting to create a website that mimcs Yelp. It is incomplete, it was my first time using Laravel in order to create a website. An issue I am having currently, is that when the user chooses to register the browser doesn't let the command go through, it makes me clear the cookies in order for it to work again. However, the user does get registered and entered into the database.

In order to run the application properly WAMP,LAMP, or MAMP needs to be installed in the computer.
